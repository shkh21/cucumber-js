1. Create project folder on your pc
2. Open the folder in visual studio code.
3. Open visual studion terminal
4. Type: npm init
5. npm install --save-dev @cucumber/cucumber
6. npm install selenium-webdriver
7. npm install chromedriver
8. Goto package.json and update the test under scripts section:
  "scripts": {
    "test": "cucumber-js --publish test"
  },
9. Install gherkin plugin from extensions of visual studio code marketplace.
10. In ur project, create a test folder. And inside test folder, create two folders: features, step-definitions.
11. Create a new file 'stefdef.js' inside step-definitions folder and write:
const { assert } = require('assert');
const { Given, When, Then, AfterAll } = require('@cucumber/cucumber');
const{Builder, By, until}=require('selenium-webdriver');

12. Create a new file 'sample.feature' inside features folder and write your scenarios here:
Feature: Cucumber Testing

    Testing of library app

    Scenario: Test email field
    Given User is on library app page
    When User enter email in email field
    And Clicks on invitation button
    Then Display success message

13. In terminal type: npm test. It will generate methods for step-definitions based on your feature file. Copy the methods from the terminals and paste it in your step-definitions file(stefdef.js).
Ex: Given('User is on library app page', async function () {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
});



When('User enter email in email field',async function () {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions

});


When('Clicks on invitation button',async function () {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
});


Then('Display success message',async function () {
    // Write code here that turns the phrase above into concrete actions
    
});

14. After that write the below method in your step-definitions file (stefdef.js):
AfterAll(async function(){
    driver.quit();
});

15. Now goto terminal and type: npm test.
A report will also be generated after the test execution.
